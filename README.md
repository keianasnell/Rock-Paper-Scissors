A sample JS/CSS/HTML project for the Girls Who Code Instructional Staff Technical Project for SIP & Campus - 2018.

"Create rock, paper, scissors game as best as you can using the language of your choice. 
You should not spend more than two hours building this game, it’s okay if you submit something that isn’t fully complete.
Do not copy and paste code to build your project, you will have a chance to talk through your work during the interview. 
This is deliberately open-ended, have fun with it!"
